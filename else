Write a function named check_fermat that takes four parameters—a, b, c and n—and
#checks to see if Fermat’s theorem holds. If n is greater than 2 and
#an + bn = cn
#the program should print, “Holy smokes, Fermat was wrong!” Otherwise the program should
#print, “No, that doesn’t work.”


        
def check_fermat(a, b, c, n):
    if n > 2 and (a**n + b**n == c**n):
        print("Holy smokes, Fermat was wrong!")
    else:
        print("No, that doesn't work.")
